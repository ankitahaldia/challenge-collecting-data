The real estate company "ImmoEliza" wants to create a machine learning model to make price predictions on real estate sales in Belgium. You must therefore create a dataset that holds the following columns :

Locality

Subtype of property (Bungalow, Chalet, Mansion, ...)
Price
Type of sale (Exclusion of life sales)
Number of rooms
Area
Fully equipped kitchen (Yes/No)
Furnished (Yes/No)
Open fire (Yes/No)
Terrace (Yes/No)
If yes: Area
Garden (Yes/No)
If yes: Area
Surface of the land
Surface area of the plot of land
Number of facades
Swimming pool (Yes/No)
State of the building (New, to be renovated, ...)
You must save everything in a csv file.

This data set should contain at least 10.000 input for all Belgium.
